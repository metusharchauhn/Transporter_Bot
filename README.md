# Transporter_Bot
i am a noobie to github so still figuring out things
the project was created under e-yantra competition conducted by IIT-Bombay
the project was implemented using a Firebird V robot
the aim of the project is to pick up blocks from different part of the arena and store it in the proper section of the  rotating structure  situated at middle-bottom end of the arena.
Simulation of the same is also performed using Blender 3D animation tool, file of which is greater than 25mb so can't be uploaded.
for the communication purpose zigbees were used.
the main navigation code for the FireBird can be found at:-Transporter_Bot/NAVIGATION/1_buzzer_beep/1_buzzer_beep.c
when the robot drops the object,a small arduino program was written to control the rotating structure mounted on a stepper motor
